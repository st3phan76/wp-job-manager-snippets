# Snippets for WP Job Manager
Simple snippets I use for WP Job Manager in WordPress.

## PHP Snippets (coming up soon)
- `Disable job promotion` ([PHP](https://github.com/st3phan76/wp-job-manager-snippets/blob/main/disable-promotion.php)) Disables the promote-option for jobs in the dashboard.
- `Register job shortcodes` ([PHP](https://github.com/st3phan76/wp-job-manager-snippets/blob/main/register-job-shortcodes.php)) Get job-fields by job-id (GET) and register them in shortcodes like [wpjm-job-title], [wpjm-job-type] ...

## Bugs & Feedback

If you have suggestions for features or how certain code works, I'd love to hear your feedback. However, I can't guarantee their implementation.
